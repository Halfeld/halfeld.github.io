# About me

Hello, my name's {{ site.title }} and I'm a **{{ site.description }}** and I currently work as Engineering Lead at [NOALVO](https://midianoalvo.com.br/), Organizer at [Vue.js Summit](https://vuejssummit.com/), Co-Organizer at [Vue.js SP](https://www.meetup.com/VueJS-SP) and [JSSP](https://www.meetup.com/Javascript-SP) Meetup.

<br />

I have worked with several technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, DynamoDB, React, React Native, GraphQl, Apollo, Immutable, Lambda AWS, SNS, SQS, Azure Functions and many more, my main programming languages are **JavaScript, Golang and Python.**

<br />

I quite like studying the engineering behind the Front End, I love understanding how the Browser works and how Javascript is parsed. Love to share knowledge and contribute to free software. Currently I live in Sao Paulo, Brazil (but I'm RJ root).  

# In free time..

    I realy like to go out with my friends to drink dome beer and have some fun! <br />
    Them're so cool but sometimes happen things unexpected.. <br />
    Talking about technology and entrepreneurship it's a recurring subject between us.

    This time is key to disconnecting from computers and not thinking about anything, it's basically a reboot in the brain.

    Another thing I like to do in free time is share knowledge, write articles, record videos and give lectures. <br />
    The most interesting part of this is the receptivity of people to my material on the internet, the sensation of happiness is inexpressible.
