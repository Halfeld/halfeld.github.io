    Hello, my name's Igor Halfeld and I'm a
    <strong
      >Software Engineer focused on Front-end engineering and
      architecture</strong
    >
    and I'm building stuff at
    <a href="https://www.estrategiaconcursos.com.br">Estrat√©gia Concursos</a>,
    Microsoft MVP, Organizer at
    <a href="https://vuejssummit.com/">Vue.js Summit</a>,

    <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nodebr/">NodeBR</a>.

    <br />
    <br />

    I have worked with several technologies like Node.js, Golang, MongoDB,
    DynamoDB, React, React Native, GraphQl, Apollo, AWS, Azure, Serverless and
    many more, my main programming languages are
    <strong>JavaScript, Golang and Python.</strong>

    <br />

    I really enjoy studying the engineering behind the Front End, I love
    understanding how the Browser works and how Javascript is parsed. Love to
    share knowledge and contribute to free software. Currently I live in Sao
    Paulo, Brazil (but I'm RJ root).

  Another thing I like to do in my free time is share knowledge, write articles,
  record videos and give lectures. <br />
  The most interesting part of this is the receptivity of people to my material
  on the internet, the sensation of happiness is awesome.
