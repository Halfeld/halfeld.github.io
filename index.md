Hello, my name's {{ site.title }} and I'm a {{ site.description }}, although the inner child still remains in front-end, I really like javascript, share the knowledge you know and contribute to free software, currently I live in Sao Paulo, Brazil (but I'm RJ root).  

JavaScript, NodeJs, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Design, UX, Python and good coffee, are part of my daily life.
In my free time, I spend time on YouTube and study new technologies.
