Hello, my name's {{ site.title }} and I'm a {{ site.description }} and I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at [NOALVO](https://midianoalvo.com.br/), Organizer at [Vue.js Summit](https://vuejssummit.com/), Co-Organizer [Vue.js SP](https://www.meetup.com/VueJS-SP) and [JSSP](https://www.meetup.com/Javascript-SP) Meetup.

<br />

I have worked with several technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, DynamoDB, React, Native React, GraphQl, Apollo, Immutable, Lambda AWS, SNS, SQS, Azure Functions and many more, my main programming languages are JavaScript, Golang and Python.

<br />

I quite like studying the engineering behind the Front End, I love understanding how the Browser works and how Javascript is parsed. Love to share knowledge and contribute to free software. Currently I live in Sao Paulo, Brazil (but I'm RJ root).
