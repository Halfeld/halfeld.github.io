## Experiences

2018/07 - Until now - Senior Software Engineer - <https://midianoalvo.com.br/>  
I decided to leave my job at Stored and switch to a job where I had iteration with people and also have contact with Back-end again.
With technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, Angular, Vue.js

2017/10 - 2018/07 - Senior Front-end Engineer - <http://stored.com.br/>  
At Stored, I started working Full Time with Vue.js and I had my first experience with remote work and with that I came to the conclusion and I really enjoy iterating with people.

2017/07 - 2017/10 - Technical Leader - <http://horizonfour.com.br/>  
Still in the Horizon Four, I had a bigger challenge, managing a team with the technologies I mentioned before, and linking time with my work at Furniture.
Yes, here I learned a lot about people and how they work

2017/03 - 2017/07 - Full Stack Developer - <http://horizonfour.com.br/>  
In Horizon Four I used Angular and React in the Front-end, and with Node.js and Python in the Back-end, but the coolest thing about it all is that everything was running AWS in Serverless environment.
AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, SQS, SNS were part of my work day.

2017/03 - 2017/07 - Full Stack Developer - <http://moveleiros.com.br/>  
At Moveleiros, I had my first first contact with .Net, but in its latest multi-platform version, The .NetCore.
however, I stayed on the Front End also with my first isomorphic application using Nuxt.js (Server Side Rendering with Vue.js)

2016/11 - 2017/03 - Full Stack Developer - <https://easycarros.com/>  
At Easycarros I had the possibility to work with a lot of people smarter than me and it was where I learned more things related to technology.
I moved with technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, React, React Native, GraphQl, Apollo, Immutable, Normalizer and application with a very large complexity.
